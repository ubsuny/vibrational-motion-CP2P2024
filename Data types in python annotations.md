#Data Types
## As I will be working on the vibrational motion of the protein, my input data has the values of eigenvectors ( displacement of the protein atoms due to vibration) at certain eigenvalues (frequencies). The input data are in scientific notation and represent decimal number, so data types of my project is floating point number i.e. 'float64'.
