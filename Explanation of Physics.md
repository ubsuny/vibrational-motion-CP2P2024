The most probable structure of protein is frequently the most energetically favorable, i.e. the lowest energy. A protein’s structure is able to fluctuate. It is not as rigidly defined as a crystal object, allowing for both large and small fluctuations relative to the protein size. When proteins are frozen, the thermal energy is much lower which will cause the the protein to move toward one of the energy minina. However,at non-zero temperatures, the protein can still move in the energy landscape.This results in an ensemble of possible folded states, the distribution of which varies for each type of protein.

The NMA method is most appropriate for modeling frozen samples, in which the structure is fairly ridged. At higher temperature the protein structure may occupy multiple conformations or move between structures due to the thermal energy. Each of these different structures each potentially have a different set of vibrational modes, due to the varying structures. Since the measurements in this work were performed at room temperature, and the samples contain a large concentration of proteins, it is necessary to include multiple protein conformations in the calculations. Normal mode analysis is performed on each minimized structure to obtain the vibrational mode frequencies, displacement vectors, and dipole derivative vectors. The eigenvectors indicate the atomic displacement of each atom in the molecule throughout the mode’s
motion. The dipole derivative is related to the net displacement of the charge during the motion.


NMA includes the motions of the solvent in the calculation. Therefore for all calculated modes, the solvent around the protein moves in concert
with the protein motion. This may lead to a double counting of some protein
motions in which the solvent moves differently for different modes while the
protein motion may be similar, or perhaps some vibrations are missed due to
this effect. In the sample, the biological water, the water within a few layers
of the protein surface, will likely move with the protein, but outside of this region, the bulk water will display a standard relaxation response. Also, the large
amount of solvent around the protein has a large impact on the dipole derivative magnitude for the NMA. These will therefore
impact the VDOS and isotropic absorbance and should be studied further to
refine the best approach for simulating the physical system.
